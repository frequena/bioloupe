## Installation

You can install the development version from Github.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("frequena/bioloupe")
```

## Overview

The package `bioloupe` provides an interface to:

#> [1] During <span style="color:lime">human</span> evolution, the knee adapted to the biomechanical demands of bipedalism by altering chondrocyte developmental programs. This adaptive process was likely not without deleterious consequences to health. Today, <span style="color:red">osteoarthritis</span> occurs in 250 million <span style="color:lime">people</span>, with risk variants enriched in non-coding sequences near chondrocyte genes, loci that likely became optimized during knee evolution. We explore this relationship by epigenetically profiling joint chondrocytes, revealing ancient selection and recent constraint and drift on knee regulatory elements, which also overlap <span style="color:red">osteoarthritis</span> variants that contribute to disease heritability by tending to modify constrained functional sequence. We propose a model whereby genetic violations to regulatory constraint, tolerated during knee development, lead to adult pathology. In support, we discover a causal enhancer variant (<span style="color:orange">rs6060369</span>) present in billions of <span style="color:lime">people</span> at a risk locus (<span style="color:green">GDF5</span>-<span style="color:green">UQCC1</span>), showing how it impacts <span style="color:lime">mouse</span> knee-shape and <span style="color:red">osteoarthritis</span>. Overall, our methods link an evolutionarily novel aspect of <span style="color:lime">human</span> anatomy to its pathogenesis.

### Find biomedical entities from a text

#### Using NCBI Text Mining Web Services

#### Using SciGraph

``` r

abstract_input <- 'Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic genetic condition affecting connective tissue. It carries a reduced life expectancy, largely dependent on cardiovascular complications. More common cardiac manifestations such as aortic dissection and aortic valve incompetence have been widely documented in the literature. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), however, has remained poorly documented. This article aims at exploring the existing literature on the pathophysiology and diagnosis of MVP in patients with Marfan syndrome, defining its current management and outlining the future developments surrounding it.'

result <- find_scigraph(text = abstract_input) 

result$content
